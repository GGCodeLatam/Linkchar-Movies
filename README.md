Application for technical test of the company **Link char**, using the API of TMDB (The Movie Data Base)

## Challenge
Create an app through the api, using react and tailwind css

## How to start the project?
You can clone the repository and after installing the dependencies, run:
**npm run dev**

## What utilities does the app have?

You can see the new movies, the most viewed, the genres, and a random cover movie. I haven't been able to finish the search engine yet.

## Used technology:
For this project use: **next js, tailwind css, axios**, some fetch to test, and other minor dependencies described in package.json.

## Future improvements:
Content from new trailers and favorite genres should be repositioned within a sidebar on mobile devices. Improve the hovers and optimize the distribution of the elements.
Finish the movie finder component.
